# UixValidations

`uix_validations` is a gem that provides Js functions for real time validations.

Uix is the abbreviation that I "created" for UI and UX, since this gem has some things from both worlds

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'uix_validations'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install uix_validations

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here (I will)

## Write good messages

Good messages can be a differential in your forms. Don't scare your users with alarming messages, like:<br>**Error: this is wrong. Use just numbers**<br>

Instead you need to focus in what is wrong and help the user to fix it. Something like:<br>
**Should have onlye numbers. Ex: 99887766**

You can read more about it here: [UX Movement, post about good messages](http://uxmovement.com/forms/how-to-make-your-form-error-messages-more-reassuring/)
